        CERN's Security Policy requires external users entering the CERN site to
        provide the following additional data. This data will not be shared with
        you and will only be revealed upon request from CERN's Site Surveillance
        service.

        Note that you usually do not need to fill out this form! When you requested
        CERN access for this user, an email with a link to this form has been sent
        to them. You may however enter the data on behalf of the user; in this case
        it is your responsibility to ensure that the data is correct and the user is
        aware that it will be stored in our database temporarily.
        <br>
        <br>
        After entering the data, the ticket will be immediately sent to the user,
        if sending tickets by email is enabled.
